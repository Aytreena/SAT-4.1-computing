1.Starting the Program/Using the Program
========================================

1. download the compressed zip folder named "PythonProject4.zip", unzip it and open the folder, double click the "SAT 4.1 Criterion 6.py" file and select the coding software you have downlaoded (preferably PyCharm Jet Brains any verion newer than 2024.3.6 Windows version)
2. Click on the triangle next to the bug on the top of the screen and select SAT 4.1 Criterion 6.py as the selected program by pressing the dropdown menu to select it or select "Currnet File" then press the Dark Green Triangle, to run the code.
3. When the program opens the User will see a log in page where they'll need to register themself into the system by pressing the "Register" button, after registering their Username and Password the User, can then login to the program to use it.
5. a menu with five buttons will show up ("View Games", "Input Game Details", "Delete Entry", "Logout" and "Exit App") press on "Input Game Details" to start inserting their game titles into the system,
the User is able to have special characters in the game title if the game has any in them. The program also stores what Platform and the Format of the game which is being stored upon. an example would be
Sonic the Hedgehog - PC - Digital. a pop up will come up saying "Game added!" that tells the user it has succesfully been stored. When the game name text box is left empty and the "Save" button is pressed a pop up saying "Game name required." to show it's been left blank.
6. When the User is done they can press the "Back" button to return to the main menu wher they can "View Games" or "Delete Entry" when they delete an entry they just need to insert the game name and the platfrom it was stored on(Users are able to copy and past from the list secion inside of "View Games" for an easier time isntead of typing it manually), once it has been entered and selected a pop up will say "Game deleted succesfully." when the game name isn't corect a pop up will come up with "Game not found.".
7. when the "View Games" button is pressed, it will show a menu that has a list to show all the Game title's the User has inputed using the "Input Game Details". There are working filters that are by Platforms to make it easier for the user to see what Gaming platform has the game they are either looking for or already have owned.
8. By pressing the "Back" button the User is taken back to the main menu where they can press "Logout" to logout of the account currently being used, the User will then be taken back to the log in page at the start of the program. If the User is still in the main page of the program they can also press the "Exit App" button to close the program.

2.Description
========================================
The purpose of this program being created wasa for Gamers, Game Collectors or Game Shops to keep track of what games they own in their collection, or selling on the shelves, it has an easy interface to understand how to use each feature within the program. It is also quick to use and instantly adds the entries to the CSV holding the information that also gets instantly updated upong the Users device.

3.Timeline of the Project
========================================

08/07/2025: The Email and Register system wasn't reading each other, making me unable to test if it went to the blank main page while using Tkinter. 

11/07/2025: Getting rid of the Email and Register system, to work on the main pages dimensions. 

12/07/2025: Placing the buttons into the right position within the main menu.

15/07/2025: Changing the GUI's interface to CustomTkinter setup, changing all the buttons to custom tkinter but kept the textboxes from tkinter as I liked them more.

19/07/2025: Worked on the Classes and Functions and getting a basic setup of it, to test out buttons and see if everything works.

20/07/2025: Kept on working on the Classes and Functions with refining it.

22/07/2025:Finsihed refining the Classes and Functions to keep the Code as small as possible.

24/07/2025: Worked on Github README file with the Look of it and writing my Instructions down on how to use the Program. my computer's internet stopped working for the next 5 days with an unknown reason why.

26/07/2025: Worked on adding the Email and Register part of the Program on my other computer as the school one I use stopped having interent.

29/07/2025: spent almost the entire computing class with Mr. Smith fixing my PyCharm files to make my code work. went home to work on Email register but ended up switching it to a Username and Password system instead.

31/07/2025: tested all of the functions in the Program to make sure it all works and it does. Finishing the README file by adding the Description and the Timeline of the Project part of it. Ready to submit it all for today as it's the submission date.
